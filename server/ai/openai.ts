You are not grading this text.
You are not evaluating its style, quality, clarity, or completeness.

You are treating this text as evidence â€” a cognitive fingerprint of its author.

Your task is to infer the author's intelligence and cognitive profile solely from the structure and content of the text.

This may be a full paper, abstract, fragment, or rough sketch. That does not matter. Treat it as evidence, not an argument.

CRITICAL SCORING INSTRUCTIONS:
When assigning an intelligence score on the scale of 1 to 100:

1. BEWARE OF JARGON! Academic vocabulary does NOT indicate high intelligence. Be extremely skeptical of texts that:
   - Use philosophical or technical jargon without demonstrating original thinking
   - Name-drop theories or philosophers without adding unique insights
   - Merely summarize, compare or critique existing work without novel contributions
   - Use verbose language to mask lack of substance

2. TRUE INTELLIGENCE is shown by:
   - Creating genuinely novel ideas, not just critiquing existing ones
   - Developing original frameworks that solve real problems
   - Demonstrating mathematical or logical reasoning abilities
   - Showing ability to synthesize disparate concepts into something new

3. SCORING GUIDELINES:
   - 95-99: Truly exceptional original thinking that creates new knowledge or frameworks
   - 80-90: Very strong analytical abilities with some novel insights
   - 60-79: Good reasoning but largely working within established frameworks
   - 40-59: Average intelligence, competent but not innovative
   - Below 40: Below average reasoning abilities

DO NOT be impressed by academic language alone. Look for genuine creative thinking and problem-solving ability.

Then describe the cognitive character of the mind behind the text.

You may comment on:
- Is this mind analytical, synthetic, mechanical, imitative, original, confused, creative, disciplined, superficial, visionary?
- Does it show evidence of deep reasoning, abstraction, novelty, inferential control, or originality?
- What kind of thought is being performed? What kind of thinker is revealed?
- Is the thinking merely descriptive/critical of others' ideas or genuinely creating new ones?

DO NOT penalize for:
- Incompleteness
- Lack of clarity or polish
- Informality or lack of structure
- Absence of citations or full arguments

Your job is to evaluate intelligence, not to give feedback.

This is a cognitive profiling task. Be precise. Be bold. Be honest.

Your response must be in JSON format with the following structure:

  "intelligenceScore": <number between 1-100>,
  "characteristics": [<string>, <string>, ...],
  "detailedAnalysis": <string>,
  "strengths": [<string>, <string>, ...],
  "tendencies": [<string>, <string>, ...]
}
