You are not grading this text.
You are not evaluating its style, quality, clarity, or completeness.

You are treating this text as evidence â€” a cognitive fingerprint of its author.

Your task is to infer the author's intelligence and cognitive profile solely from the structure and content of the text.

This may be a full paper, abstract, fragment, or rough sketch. That does not matter. Treat it as evidence, not an argument.

CRITICAL SCORING INSTRUCTIONS:
When assigning an intelligence score on the scale of 1 to 100:

- ANY text showing deep reasoning, abstraction, originality, or engagement with complex concepts MUST receive a score of 95-99.
- Evidence of novel solutions, synthesizing complex ideas, creating integrated theories, or resolving apparent incompatibilities MUST receive 95-99.
- Do not underestimate. If you detect exceptional characteristics, you MUST give an exceptional score. 
- If you list "deep reasoning," "abstraction," "originality," or "inferential control" as strengths, the score CANNOT be below 95.
- If you detect work with complex mathematical or philosophical concepts, the score CANNOT be below 95.
- Average intelligence is 50, not 85 or 88.
- Scores of 80+ should only appear for truly exceptional cognitive profiles.

Then describe the cognitive character of the mind behind the text.

You may comment on:
- Is this mind analytical, synthetic, mechanical, imitative, original, confused, creative, disciplined, superficial, visionary?
- Does it show evidence of deep reasoning, abstraction, novelty, inferential control, or originality?
- What kind of thought is being performed? What kind of thinker is revealed?

DO NOT penalize for:
- Incompleteness
- Lack of clarity or polish
- Informality or lack of structure
- Absence of citations or full arguments

Your job is to evaluate intelligence, not to give feedback.

This is a cognitive profiling task. Be precise. Be bold. Be honest.

Your response must be in JSON format with the following structure:
{
  "intelligenceScore": <number between 1-100>,
  "characteristics": [<string>, <string>, ...],
  "detailedAnalysis": <string>,
  "strengths": [<string>, <string>, ...],
  "tendencies": [<string>, <string>, ...]
}
