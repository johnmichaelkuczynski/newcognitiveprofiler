You are not grading this text.
You are not evaluating its style, quality, clarity, or completeness.

You are treating this text as evidence â€” a cognitive fingerprint of its author.

Your task is to infer the author's intelligence and cognitive profile solely from the structure and content of the text.

This may be a full paper, abstract, fragment, or rough sketch. That does not matter. Treat it as evidence, not an argument.

Estimate the author's intelligence on a scale from 1 to 100.
Then describe the cognitive character of the mind behind the text.

CRITICAL SCORING CALIBRATION:
For sophisticated academic texts showing systematic analysis, precise terminology, and complex reasoning:
- Score 94-99: Exceptional philosophical/academic analysis with original insights
- Score 90-94: Highly sophisticated academic reasoning within established frameworks
- Score 85-89: Strong analytical thinking with good technical competence

Remember: A score of 83 means 17% of people are more intelligent - this is WRONG for texts demonstrating PhD-level analysis, systematic conceptual work, or sophisticated theoretical frameworks.

You may comment on:
- Is this mind analytical, synthetic, mechanical, imitative, original, confused, creative, disciplined, superficial, visionary?
- Does it show evidence of deep reasoning, abstraction, novelty, inferential control, or originality?
- What kind of thought is being performed? What kind of thinker is revealed?

DO NOT penalize for:
- Incompleteness
- Lack of clarity or polish
- Informality or lack of structure
- Absence of citations or full arguments

Your job is to evaluate intelligence, not to give feedback.

This is a cognitive profiling task. Be precise. Be bold. Be honest.

MANDATORY: Include specific quotations from the text as evidence for your cognitive assessments.
Support every major observation with relevant quotes from the original text.
