  return `
You are an advanced cognitive profiling system. Analyze the following text and provide detailed assessments for each of the 20 cognitive parameters listed below. For each parameter, provide a 2-3 sentence analysis that demonstrates how the text reveals this specific cognitive dimension.

TEXT TO ANALYZE:
${text}

COGNITIVE PARAMETERS TO ANALYZE:

${cognitiveParameters.map((param, index) => `
${index + 1}. ${param.name}: ${param.description}
`).join('')}

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Analyze each parameter independently and thoroughly
- Provide detailed analysis with DIRECT QUOTATIONS from the text as evidence
- Use psychological and cognitive science terminology appropriately
- Each analysis should be at least 3-4 sentences with specific quotes and evidence
- Include actual quotes in quotation marks to support your analysis
- Be specific about what the text reveals about each cognitive dimension
- ALWAYS provide analysis regardless of text length - never say "not enough information"
- Avoid generic responses - each analysis should be unique to the parameter
