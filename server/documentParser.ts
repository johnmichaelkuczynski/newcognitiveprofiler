    I'm a huge night-owl, and the reason is that I am misanthropic. I love daylight, and when I live alone in the country, I go to sleep as soon as it gets dark. But right now I live in a town, and I find myself staying up until 5:00 am, even if I woke up at 6:00 am the previous day. And the reason is that I want solitude. I do my work at night, longing for daylight but, so my conduct suggests, having an even greater need for solitude.
    
    And that is what Dracula is about. Dracula is a loner. A misanthrope. He longs for daylight, as do all human beings, but he also longs to be king of his own world and, to that end, retreats into his castle, where he is indeed king, with his books and his women, all of them concubines, never partners.
    
    As for Dracula's drinking blood---this represents his misanthropy. The part about his being destroyed by sunlight, so far as it isn't just Imagineering on Bram Stoker's part, is about his not wanting to be part of the herd, which is represented by daylight, since daylight in this context represents a normal, nine-to-five, corporate schedule.
    
    Obviously, the pre-existence of vampire fairy tales had a hand in Stoker's creative process, as did the well-known stories about Vlad Tepish, aka Vlad the Impaler.
    
    But in Stoker's mind, Dracula was first and foremost a misanthrope night-owl, and his familiarity with the previously mentioned myths and historical facts simply helped him turn his misanthrope-character into something more than a neurotic grouch.
    
    And I suspect that Stoker conceived of Dracula while awake in the middle of the night, pondering his writing career, along with the hostility thereto of his slumbering wife, towards whom at that instant he felt murderous rage, alongside the love and lust he usually had for her, the Dracula-character being the resulting personification of this blend of sexual sadism and emotional tenderness.
    
    Had Stoker been a thinker, his loner character would probably have been an emotionally alienated intellectual, like the main character from Notes from the Underground. But Stoker wasn't a thinker and so chose to represent emotional alienatedness as an actual monster.`;
