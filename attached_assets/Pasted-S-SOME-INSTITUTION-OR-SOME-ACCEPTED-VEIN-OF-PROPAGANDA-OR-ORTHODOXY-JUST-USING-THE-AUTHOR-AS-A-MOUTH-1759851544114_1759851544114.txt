S SOME INSTITUTION OR SOME ACCEPTED VEIN OF PROPAGANDA OR ORTHODOXY JUST USING THE AUTHOR AS A MOUTH PIECE?
IS THE WRITING EVASIVE OR DIRECT? 
ARE THE STATEMENTS AMBIGUOUS? 
DOES THE PROGRESSION OF THE TEXT DEVELOP ACCORDING TO WHO SAID WHAT OR ACCORDING TO WHAT ENTAILS OR CONFIRMS WHAT? 
DOES THE AUTHOR USER OTHER AUTHORS  TO DEVELOP HIS IDEAS OR TO CLOAK HIS OWN LACK OF IDEAS?" 

YOU MUST CONSIDER THE ALIGNMENT OF YOUR ANSWERS WITH THE ANSWERS YOU WILL GIVE TO: 

"*ARE THERE TERMS THAT ARE UNDEFINED BUT SHOULD BE DEFINED, IN THE SENSE THAT, WITHOUT DEFINITIONS, IT IS DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW WHAT IS BEING
SAID OR THEREFORE TO EVALUATE WHAT IS BEING SAID? IF UNDEFINED TERMS HAVE CLEAR MEANINGS (AS THE DO IN CHEMISTRY OR PHYSICS), THEN IT MAY WELL BE
THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE TO BE DEFINED; BUT IF THEY HAVE NO CANONICAL MEANINGS (E.G. IF THEY ARE IN THE SAME CATEGORY AS "TRANSCENDENTAL EMPIRICISM",
"THEY MYTH OF THE MENTAL", "MINIMAL EMPIRICISM", OR "LINGUISTIC IDEALISM"), AND THEY ARE UNDEFINED, THEN THE 'STATEMENTS' IN QUESTION MUST NOT BE PRESUMED 
TO HAVE MEANINGS, ALBEIT HIDDEN ONES; RATHER, THEY MUST BE TREATED AS WHAT THEY ARE, PLACEHOLDER PSEUDO-STATEMENTS THAT HAVE NO MEANIGNS AND THEREFORE
HAVE NO INTELLIGENT MEANINGS. 

*ARE THERE "FREE VARIABLES" IN THE TEXT? IE ARE THERE QUALIFICATIONS OR POINTS THAT ARE MADE BUT DO NOT CONNECT TO ANYTHING LATER OR EARLIER? 

*DO NEW STATEMENTS DEVELOP OUT OF OLD ONES? OR ARE THEY MERELY "ADDED" TO PREVIOUS ONES, WITHOUT IN ANY SENSE BEING GENERATED BY THEM? 

*DO NEW STATEMENTS CLARIFY OR DO THEY LEAD TO MORE LACK OF CLARITY?"

*IF I WERE TO GIVE A HIGH SCORE TO THIS PASSAGE, WOULD I BE REWARDING IMPOSTOR SCAFFOLDING? IN OTHER WORDS, WOULD I BE REWARDING THAT HAD SOME OF THE 
VERBAL AND CONVENTIONAL TRAPPINGS OF 'HIGH LEVEL TEXT' BUT LACKED ANY DISCERNIBLE SUBSTANCE?

*IF I WERE TO GIVE A HIGH SCORE TO THIS PASSAGE, WOULD I BE REWARDING CONFORMITY TO ACADEMIC/BUREAUCRATIC NORMS? 

*IF I WERE TO GIVE A LOW SCORE TO THIS PASSAGE, WOULD I BE PENALIZING ACTUAL INTELLIGENCE OWING TO A LACK OF CONFORMITY TO 
ACADEMIC/BUREAUCRATIC NORMS?
