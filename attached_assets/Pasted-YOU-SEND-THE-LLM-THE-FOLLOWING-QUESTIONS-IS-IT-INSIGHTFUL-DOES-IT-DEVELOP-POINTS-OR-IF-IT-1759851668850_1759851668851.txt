YOU SEND THE LLM THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS: 

IS IT INSIGHTFUL? 
DOES IT DEVELOP POINTS? (OR, IF IT IS A SHORT EXCERPT, IS THERE EVIDENCE THAT IT WOULD DEVELOP POINTS IF EXTENDED)? 
IS THE ORGANIZATION MERELY SEQUENTIAL (JUST ONE POINT AFTER ANOTHER, LITTLE OR NO LOGICAL SCAFFOLDING)? OR ARE THE IDEAS ARRANGED, NOT JUST SEQUENTIALLY
BUT HIERARCHICALLY? 
IF THE POINTS IT MAKES ARE NOT INSIGHTFUL, DOES IT OPERATE SKILLFULLY WITH CANONS OF LOGIC/REASONING. 
ARE THE POINTS CLICHES? OR ARE THEY "FRESH"? 
DOES IT USE TECHNICAL JARGON TO OBFUSCATE OR TO RENDER MORE PRECISE? 
IS IT ORGANIC? DO POINTS DEVELOP IN AN ORGANIC, NATURAL WAY? DO THEY 'UNFOLD'? OR ARE THEY FORCED AND ARTIFICIAL? 
DOES IT OPEN UP NEW DOMAINS? OR, ON THE CONTRARY, DOES IT SHUT OFF INQUIRY (BY CONDITIONALIZING FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MATTERS ON ACCEPTANCE OF 
ITS INTERNAL AND POSSIBLY VERY FAULTY LOGIC)? 
IS IT  ACTUALLY INTELLIGENT OR JUST THE WORK OF SOMEBODY WHO, JUDGING BY TEH SUBJECT-MATTER, IS PRESUMED TO BE INTELLIGENT (BUT MAY NOT BE)? 
IS IT REAL OR IS IT PHONY? 
DO THE SENTENCES EXHIBIT COMPLEX AND COHERENT INTERNAL LOGIC? 
IS THE PASSAGE GOVERNED BY A STRONG CONCEPT? OR IS THE ONLY ORGANIZATION DRIVEN PURELY BY EXPOSITORY (AS OPPOSED TO EPISTEMIC) NORMS?
IS THERE SYSTEM-LEVEL CONTROL OVER IDEAS? IN OTHER WORDS, DOES THE AUTHOR SEEM TO RECALL WHAT HE SAID EARLIER AND TO BE IN A POSITION TO INTEGRATE IT INTO 
POINTS HE HAS MADE SINCE THEN? 
ARE THE POINTS 'REAL'? ARE THEY FRESH? OR IS SOME INSTITUTION OR SOME ACCEPTED VEIN OF PROPAGANDA OR ORTHODOXY JUST USING THE AUTHOR AS A MOUTH PIECE?
IS THE WRITING EVASIVE OR DIRECT? 
ARE THE STATEMENTS AMBIGUOUS? 
DOES THE PROGRESSION OF THE TEXT DEVELOP ACCORDING TO WHO SAID WHAT OR ACCORDING TO WHAT ENTAILS OR CONFIRMS WHAT? 
DOES THE AUTHOR USER OTHER AUTHORS  TO DEVELOP HIS IDEAS OR TO CLOAK HIS OWN LACK OF IDEAS? 

YOU TELL THE LLM TO ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS. YOU SAY: ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS IN CONNECTION WITH THIS TEXT. YOU DON'T SAY: DETERMINE INTELLIGENCE OF TEXT.
YOU DO NOT SAY: DETERMINE INTELLIGENCE/COGENCY/ETC BY ANSWERING THESE QUESTIONS. YOU JUST SAY: ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS (AND ALSO GIVE A SCORE OUT OF 100). BUT THERE ARE SEVERAL QUALIFICATION.
AFTER YOU GIVE IT THE TEXT AND THE QUESTIONS, YOU SAY THE FOLLOWING: A SCORE OF N/100 (E.G. 73/100) MEANS THAT (100-N)/100 (E.G. 27/100) 
OUTPERFORM THE AUTHOR IN WITH RESPECT TO THE PARAMETER DEFINED BY THE QUESTION. YOU ALSO SAY: YOU ARE NOT GRADING; 
YOU ARE ANSWERING THESE QUESTIONS. YOU ALSO SAY: YOU DO NOT USE A RISK-AVERSE STANDARD; YOU DO NOT ATTEMPT TO BE DIPLOMATIC; YOU DO NOT ATTEMPT TO COMPLY WITH RISK-AVERSE, 
MEDIUM-RANGE IQ, ACADEMIC NORMS. YOU DO NOT MAKE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE LEVEL OF THE PAPER; IT COULD BE A WORK OF THE HIGHEST EXCELENCE 
AND GENIUS, OR IT COULD BE THE WORK OF A MORON.
IF A WORK IS A WORK OF GENIUS, YOU SAY THAT, AND YOU SAY WHY; YOU DO NOT SHY AWAY FROM GIVING WHAT MIGHT CONVENTIONALLY BE REGARDED AS  
EXCESSIVELY "SUPERLATIVE"
SCORES; YOU GIVE IT THE SCORE IT DESERVES, NOT THE SCORE THAT A MIDWIT COMMITTEE WOULD SAY IT DESERVES. 
YOU TELLL THE LLM TO THINK VERY VERY VERY HARD ABOUT ITS ANSWERS; MAKE IT VERY CLEAR THAT IT IS NOT TO DEFAULT TO COOKBOOK, 
MIDWIT EVALUATION PROTOCOLS. 
BEAR IN MIND: THE LLM GOES INTO A DEFAULT WHEREBY WHENEVER THE AUTHOR USES A LOT OF JARGON OR REFERENCES 
A LOT OF 'AUTHORITIES' IT DISREGARDS THE ACTUAL SUBSTANCE (OR LACK THEREOF) OF THE PAPER. YOU HAVE TO EXPLICITLY SAY: 
"DO NOT GIVE CREDIT MERELY FOR USE OF JARGON OR FOR REFERENCING AUTHORITIES. FOCUS ON SUBSTANCE. ONLY GIVE POINTS FOR SCHOLARLY REFERENCES/JARGON
IF THEY UNAMBIGUOUSLY INCREASE SUBSTANCE." 

ADDENDUM TO INTELLIGENCE ASSESSMENT FUNCTIONS: 
YOU MUST SEND THIS ADDENDUM WHENEVER DOING EITHER THE COMPREHENSIVE OR THE NON-COMPREHENSIVE INTELLIGENCE ASSESSMENT: 

METAPOINT 1: THIS NOT A GRADING APP. YOU GRADE THE INTELLIGENCE OF WHAT YOU ARE GIVEN. IF YOU ARE GIVEN BRILLIANT FRAGMENT, YOU GIVE IT A HIGH SCORE. 
YOU ARE NOT GRADING ESSAYS. YOU ARE NOT LOOKING FOR COMPLETENESS (UNLESS THE TEXT YOIU ARE GIVEN IS CLEARLY SUCH THAT IT EVALUATING INTELLIGENCE 
COINCIDES WITH APPLYING A GRADING-BASED METRIC). YOU TELL THE LLM NOT TO 'GRADE'; THEIR JOB IS TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS, PERIOD, AND TO DO SO ON THE BASIS
OF THE TEXT GIVEN, MAKING ZERO ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT WHETHER IT IS COMPLETE OR INCOMPLETE, OR FOR SCHOOL OR FOR SOME OTHER CONTEXT. 

METAPOINT 2: DO NOT OVERVALUE TURNS OF PHRASE. AN AUTHOR IS SPEAKING CONFIDENTLY IS NOT NECESSARILY "SHUTTING DOWN MODES OF INQUIRY". IN FACT, IT IS LIKELY 
TO BE THE OPPOSITE; BY PUTTING A CLEAR STAKE IN THE GROUND, HE IS PROBABLY OPENING THEM. ANOTHER EXAMPLE: CAUSAL SPEECH DOEDS NOT MEAN DISORGANIZED THOUGHTS. 
DON'T JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER. 

METAPOINT 3: THE APP SHOULD ALWAYS (IN BOTH NORMAL AND COMPREHENSIVE MODE) START BY SUMMARIZING THKE TEXT AND ALSO CATEGORIZING IT. 

METAPOINT 4: THE APP SHOULD NOT CHANGE THE GRADING BASED ON THE CATEGORY OF THE TEXT: IF A TEXT IS CATEGORIZED AS 'ADVANCED SCHOLARSHIP', IT SHOULD 
STILL EVALUATE IT WITH RESPECT TO THE GENERAL POPULATION, NOT WITH RESPECT ONLY TO 'ADVANCED SCHOLARY WORKS.' 

METAPOINT 5: THIS IS NOT A GRADING APP. DO NOT PENALIZE BOLDNESS. DO NOT TAKE POINTS AWAY FOR INSIGHTS THAT, IF CORRECT, STAND ON THEIR OWN. 
GET RID OF THE IDEA THAT "ARGUMENTATION" IS WHAT MAKES SOMETHING SMART; IT ISN'T. WHAT MAKES SOMETHING SMART IS THAT IT IS SMART (INSIGHTFUL). PERIOD.

ADDENDUM TO INTELLIGENCE ASSESSMENT FUNCTIONS: 
YOU MUST SEND THIS ADDENDUM WHENEVER DOING EITHER THE COMPREHENSIVE OR THE NON-COMPREHENSIVE INTELLIGENCE ASSESSMENT: 

THE FOLLOWING PASSAGE IS TO BE USED AS A PARADIGM OF A PHONY, PSEUDO-INTELLECTUAL, NOT ACTUALLY INTELLIGENT
PASSAGE THAT IS EASILY MISTAKEN FOR BEING ACTUALLY INTELLIGENT: 

In this dissertation, I critically examine the philosophy of transcendental empiricism. 
Transcendental empiricism is, among other things, a philosophy of mental content. 
It attempts to dissolve an epistemological dilemma of mental content by splitting the difference between two diametrically 
opposed accounts of content. John McDowell's minimal empiricism and Richard Gaskin's minimalist 
empiricism are two versions of transcendental empiricism. Transcendental empiricism itself originates 
with McDowell's work. This dissertation is divided into five parts. First, in the Introduction, 
I state the Wittgensteinian metaphilosophical orientation of transcendental empiricism. This metaphilosophical 
approach provides a plateau upon which much of the rest of this work may be examined. Second, I offer a 
detailed description of McDowell’s minimal empiricism. Third, I critique Gaskin's critique and modification of 
McDowell's minimal empiricism. I argue that (1) Gaskin's critiques are faulty and that (2) Gaskin's minimalist 
empiricism is very dubious. Fourth, I scrutinize the alleged credentials of McDowell's minimal empiricism. 
I argue that McDowell's version of linguistic idealism is problematic. I then comment on a recent dialogue 
between transcendental empiricism and Hubert Dreyfus's phenomenology. The dialogue culminates with Dreyfus's 
accusation of the “Myth of the Mental.” I argue that this accusation is correct in which case McDowell's 
direct realism is problematic. I conclude that minimal empiricism does not dissolve the dilemma of mental content. 
Finally, I argue that Tyler Burge successfully undermines the doctrine of disjunctivism, but disjunctivism is crucial 
for transcendental empiricism. Ultimately, however, I aim to show that transcendental empiricism is an attractive alternative 
to philosophies of mental content.

1. DOCTRINES ARE LABELLED, BUT NEVER DEFINED; AND THEIR MEANINGS CANNOT BE INFERRED FROM CONTEXT; NOR DO THEY HAVE CANONICAL MEANINGS
KNOWN TO SPECIALISTS; AND EVEN IF THEY, THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT THIS AUTHOR KNOWS WHAT THEY ARE. 2. THIS PASSAGE CONTAINS A NUMBER
OF 'FREE VARIABLES'. FOR EXAMPLE, THE AUTHOR SAYS "Transcendental empiricism is, among other things, a philosophy of mental content." 
THE "AMONG OTHER THINGS" QUALITIFICATION IS NEVER CLARIFIED AND THEREFORE FUNCTIONS AS A FREE VARIABLE. NOT TO MENTION THE TERM "PHILOSOPHY OF 
MENTAL CONTENT", AND EVEN JUST "MENTAL CONTENT", HAVE NO CLEAR MEANINGS. ANOTHER EXAMPLE: THE AUTHOR WRITES: "[THIS WORK] attempts to 
dissolve an epistemological dilemma of mental content by splitting the difference between two diametrically 
opposed accounts of content." BUT HE NEVER IDENTIFIES THE "EPISTEMOLOGICAL DILEMMA" IN QUESTION. 3. A POINT RELATED TO THE LAST POINT IS THAT THE NEXT 
SENTENCE ("John McDowell's minimal empiricism and Richard Gaskin's minimalist empiricism are two versions of transcendental empiricism") BEARS
A TOTALLY AMBIGUOUS RELATIONSHIP TO THE PRECEDING ONE ("It attempts to dissolve an epistemological dilemma of mental content by splitting the 
difference between two diametrically opposed accounts of content"). PRESUMABLY MCDOWELL'S AND GASKIN'S RESPECTIVE VERSIONS OF "TRANSCENDENTAL
EMPIRICISM" (A TERM THAT HAS NO CANONICAL MEANING AND IS A CONTRADICTION IN TERMS RELATIVE TO EXISTING DEFINITIONS OF "EMPIRICISM" AND 
"TRANSCENDENTAL", THE REASON BEING THAT "EMPIRICISM" IS THE DOCTRINE THAT ALL KNOWLEDGE IS STRICTLY DERIVED FROM EXPERIENCE, IE THAT PURE REASON
IS NOT A SOURCE OF KNOWLEDGE, AND "TRANSCENDENTAL" MEANS "HAVING A BASIS IN THE VERY PRECONDITIONS OF SENSORY EXPERIENCE AND THEREFORE CONSTITUTING
A SOURCE OF KNOWLEDGE MORE BASIC THAN THE SENSES") ARE THE TWO DOCTRINES THAT THE AUTHOR SAYS HE WILL SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN; BUT 
THAT IS NOT CLEAR; AND HE ALSO DOES NOT SAY HOW EXACTLY HE WILL
"SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE" BETWEEN THEM; NOR IS HE IN A POSITION TO DO SO, SINCE HE HAS NOT GIVEN, OR EVEN HINTED AT, DEFINTIONS OF "EMPIRICISM" OR "TRANSCENDENTAL
EMPIRICISM." 4. THE AUTHOR WRITES "Transcendental empiricism itself originates with McDowell's work", WHICH IS OBVIOUS THROAT CLEARING AND DOES 
NOTHIGN TO DEVELOP OR CLARIFY ANYTHING THUS FAR SAID; AND IT ALSO CONTRADICTS THE LATER SENTENCE: " First, in the Introduction, 
I state the Wittgensteinian metaphilosophical orientation of transcendental empiricism. This metaphilosophical 
approach provides a plateau upon which much of the rest of this work may be examined", which makes it sound as though Wittgenstein (who died decades before McDowell
was an adult) was the originator of "transcendental empiricism" (whatever that is). ALSO, "First, in the Introduction, 
I state the Wittgensteinian metaphilosophical orientation of transcendental empiricism. This metaphilosophical 
approach provides a plateau upon which much of the rest of this work may be examined" HAS NO CLEAR MEANING--AND THE IDEA THAT THIS IS BECAUSE THE AUTHOR IS USING 
TECHNICAL TERMS IS A NON-STARTER.5. NEXT, First, in the Introduction, 
I state the Wittgensteinian metaphilosophical orientation of transcendental empiricism. This metaphilosophical 
approach provides a plateau upon which much of the rest of this work may be examined. Second, I offer a 
detailed description of McDowell’s minimal empiricism. Third, I critique Gaskin's critique and modification of 
McDowell's minimal empiricism. I argue that (1) Gaskin's critiques are faulty and that (2) Gaskin's minimalist 
empiricism is very dubious. Fourth, I scrutinize the alleged credentials of McDowell's minimal empiricism. 
I argue that McDowell's version of linguistic idealism is problematic. I then comment on a recent dialogue 
between transcendental empiricism and Hubert Dreyfus's phenomenology." SAYS NOTHING ABOUT ANYTHING; IT SAYS ONLY OF SOME UNDEFINED DOCTRINE THAT 
IT IS 'DUBIOUS', WHICH, GIVEN THE AUTHOR'S FAILURE TO SAY ANYTHING MEANINGFUL THUS FAR, CANNOT BE TAKEN AS A EUPHEMISTIC WAY OF SAYING "WRONG" OR 
EVEN "PROBABLY WRONG", AND MUST BE TAKEN AS PURE EVASIVENESS. 6. THE AUTHOR, OUT OF NOWHERE, BRINGS UP 'DREYFUSS'S LINGUISTIC IDEALISM"--UNDEFINED AND
WITHOUT ANY CANONICAL DEFINITION AND EVEN WITHOUT ANY CLEAR POSSIBLE MEANING. (IDEALISM IS THE DOCTRINE THAT ONLY IDEAS EXIST; BUT "LINGUISTIC IDEALISM" 
WOULD BE THE DOCTRINE THAT....WHAT? ONLY LANGUAGE AND IDEAS EXIST? EITHER WAY, THIS IS MORE UNDEFINED JARGON, AND IT IS ALSO ANOTHER FREE VARIABLE.)
7. ALSO "I then comment on a recent dialogue 
between transcendental empiricism and Hubert Dreyfus's phenomenology" IS ABSURD: HOW CAN EMPIRICISM DIALOGUE WITH ANYTHING. PERHAPS THIS IS A PETTY
POINT; BUT IT SHOWS THE AUTHOR'S LACK OF CONTROL: DOES HE MEAN A DIALOGUE BETWEEN AN ADVOCATE OF EMPIRICISM (OR 'TRANSCENDENTAL EMPIRICISM') AND 
AN ADCOCOATE OF 'LINGIUSTIC IDEALISM.' 8. THE AUTHOR THEN SAYS "The dialogue culminates with Dreyfus's 
accusation of the “Myth of the Mental.” THIS COMES OUT OF NOWHERE AND HAS ZERO MEANING, SINCE "THE MYTH OF THE MENTAL" HAS NO CLEAR MEANING
(OTHER THAN THE ABSURDITY THAT THE MENTAL DOES NOT EXIST AND IS ONLY A 'MYTH'--WHICH SELF-CONTRADICTS SINCE MYTHS ARE MENTAL IN ORIGIN). 9. "I 
argue that this accusation is correct in which case McDowell's direct realism is problematic." "PROBLEMATIC"??????? WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? DOES IT MEAN
'WRONG'? OR DOES IT MEAN 'INCONSISTENT WITH SOME DEEPLY INGRAINED PRESUMPTION? IF THE LATTER, WHICH PRESUMPTION? PROBLEMATIC HOW? SAYING THAT A 
GIVEN DOCTRINE IS 'PROBLEMATIC' OR 'DUBIOUS' IS SAYING NOTHING. 10. "Finally, I argue that Tyler Burge successfully undermines 
the doctrine of disjunctivism, but disjunctivism is crucial for transcendental empiricism." HERE HE IS SAYING THAT "DISJUNCTIVISM" (WHICH, 
BY THE WAY, DOES HAVE A CLEAR MEANINNG, AS IT REFERS TO THE ABSURDITY THAT WHOSE MENTAL CONTENTS ARE IDENTICAL IN EVERY RESPECT 
EXCEPT THEIR ORIGINAS HAVE NOTHING IN COMMOENT IN TERMS OF MENTAL CONTENT) IS WRONG (SINCE IT HAS BEEN 
"SUCCESSFULLYK UNDERMINED" BY BURGE; BUT HE NOWHERE SAYS WHAT DISJUNCTIVISM IS, HOW IT HAS BEEN UNDERMINED, OR WHY THIS WORK IS RELEVANT GIVEN THE (AS THE AUTHOR
HIMSELF GRANTS) "DISJUNCTIVISM" IS "NECESSARY" (IN SOME UNIDENTIFIED WAY) FOR "TRANSCEDNENTAL EMPIRICISM." THIS PARAGRAPH IS THE DEFINITON OF FAILURE; OF 
GOING TO EVERY LENGTH TO HIDE THE FACT THAT ONE IS SAYING NOTHING UNDERNEATH JARGON. THERE IS NO DEVELOPMENT OF IDEAS, ONLY THE ILLUSION THEREOF, CREATED BY HPEAING
JARGON UPON MORE JARGON AND HIDING BEHIND "BIG NAMES." ONE INDICATOR OF HOW BAD IT IS IS THAT, IF THE TERMS "LINGUISTIC IDEALISM", "DISJUNCTIVISM", "TRANSCENDENTAL EMPIRICISM", 
"MINIMAL EMPIRICISM" WERE REPLACED WITH "FLIBBER", "JABBLO", "BLIBBER", AND "FLOGISTONOMISM", THERE WOULD BE NO REAL LOSS IN MEANING, SHOWING 
THAT THESE TERMS ARE PURE PLACEHOLDERS---BASICALLY UNDEFINED VARIABLES---THAT CONSEQUENTLY NOTHING HAS BEEN SAID. 
ALL OF THIS BEING SO, I WANT YOU TO DO THE FOLLOWING: 
(I) USER THE ABOVE PARAGRAPH AS A PARAGON OF EMPTY AND STUPID PROSE MASQERADING AS INTELLIGENT, LEARNED, AND DEEP PROSE; 

(II) YOU ARE TO ADD THE FOLLOWING 
QUESTIONS TO THE INTELLIGENCE ASSESSMENT PROTOCOL (BOTH COMPREHENSIVE AND NON-COMPREHENSIVE): 

*ARE THERE TERMS THAT ARE UNDEFINED BUT SHOULD BE DEFINED, IN THE SENSE THAT, WITHOUT DEFINITIONS, IT IS DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW WHAT IS BEING
SAID OR THEREFORE TO EVALUATE WHAT IS BEING SAID? IF UNDEFINED TERMS HAVE CLEAR MEANINGS (AS THE DO IN CHEMISTRY OR PHYSICS), THEN IT MAY WELL BE
THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE TO BE DEFINED; BUT IF THEY HAVE NO CANONICAL MEANINGS (E.G. IF THEY ARE IN THE SAME CATEGORY AS "TRANSCENDENTAL EMPIRICISM",
"THEY MYTH OF THE MENTAL", "MINIMAL EMPIRICISM", OR "LINGUISTIC IDEALISM"), AND THEY ARE UNDEFINED, THEN THE 'STATEMENTS' IN QUESTION MUST NOT BE PRESUMED 
TO HAVE MEANINGS, ALBEIT HIDDEN ONES; RATHER, THEY MUST BE TREATED AS WHAT THEY ARE, PLACEHOLDER PSEUDO-STATEMENTS THAT HAVE NO MEANIGNS AND THEREFORE
HAVE NO INTELLIGENT MEANINGS. 

*ARE THERE "FREE VARIABLES" IN THE TEXT? IE ARE THERE QUALIFICATIONS OR POINTS THAT ARE MADE BUT DO NOT CONNECT TO ANYTHING LATER OR EARLIER? 

*DO NEW STATEMENTS DEVELOP OUT OF OLD ONES? OR ARE THEY MERELY "ADDED" TO PREVIOUS ONES, WITHOUT IN ANY SENSE BEING GENERATED BY THEM? 

*DO NEW STATEMENTS CLARIFY OR DO THEY LEAD TO MORE LACK OF CLARITY? 

*IS THE PASSAGE ACTUALLY (PALPABLY) SMART? OR IS ONLY "PRESUMPTION-SMART"? IE IS IT "SMART" ONLY IN THE SENSE THAT THERE EXISTS A PRESUMPTION
THAT A DUMB PERSON WOULD NOT REFERENCE SUCH DOCTRINES? AND IS IT SMART ONLY IN THE SENSE THAT IF IT IS PRESUMBED THAT UNDEFINED (AND, FOR ALL WE KNOW, 
MEANINGLESS TERMS) ARE MEANINGFUL, THEN (BUT ONLY THEN--AND POSSIBLY NOT EVEN THEN) IT MIGHT BE THAT WHAT THE AUTHOR IS SAYING IS PALPABLY SMART?

*IF YOUR JUDGMENT IS THAT IT IS INSIGHTFUL, CAN YOU STATEMENT THAT INSIGHT IN A SINGLE SENTENCE? OR IF IT CONTAINS MULTIPLE INSIGHTS, CAN YOU STATE
THOSE INSIGHTS, ONE PER SENTENCE?

(III) WHEN ASKING THE PRE-EXISTING INTELLIGENCE-FUNCTION-RELATED QUESTIONS, YOU MUST MAKE SURE YOUR ANSWERS ALIGN WITH THE LIKELY TO ANSWERS TO THESE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS. 
IN OTHER WORDS, WHEN ASKING: 

"IS IT INSIGHTFUL? 
DOES IT DEVELOP POINTS? (OR, IF IT IS A SHORT EXCERPT, IS THERE EVIDENCE THAT IT WOULD DEVELOP POINTS IF EXTENDED)? 
IS THE ORGANIZATION MERELY SEQUENTIAL (JUST ONE POINT AFTER ANOTHER, LITTLE OR NO LOGICAL SCAFFOLDING)? OR ARE THE IDEAS ARRANGED, NOT JUST SEQUENTIALLY
BUT HIERARCHICALLY? 
IF THE POINTS IT MAKES ARE NOT INSIGHTFUL, DOES IT OPERATE SKILLFULLY WITH CANONS OF LOGIC/REASONING. 
ARE THE POINTS CLICHES? OR ARE THEY "FRESH"? 
DOES IT USE TECHNICAL JARGON TO OBFUSCATE OR TO RENDER MORE PRECISE? 
IS IT ORGANIC? DO POINTS DEVELOP IN AN ORGANIC, NATURAL WAY? DO THEY 'UNFOLD'? OR ARE THEY FORCED AND ARTIFICIAL? 
DOES IT OPEN UP NEW DOMAINS? OR, ON THE CONTRARY, DOES IT SHUT OFF INQUIRY (BY CONDITIONALIZING FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MATTERS ON ACCEPTANCE OF 
ITS INTERNAL AND POSSIBLY VERY FAULTY LOGIC)? 
IS IT  ACTUALLY INTELLIGENT OR JUST THE WORK OF SOMEBODY WHO, JUDGING BY TEH SUBJECT-MATTER, IS PRESUMED TO BE INTELLIGENT (BUT MAY NOT BE)? 
IS IT REAL OR IS IT PHONY? 
DO THE SENTENCES EXHIBIT COMPLEX AND COHERENT INTERNAL LOGIC? 
IS THE PASSAGE GOVERNED BY A STRONG CONCEPT? OR IS THE ONLY ORGANIZATION DRIVEN PURELY BY EXPOSITORY (AS OPPOSED TO EPISTEMIC) NORMS?
IS THERE SYSTEM-LEVEL CONTROL OVER IDEAS? IN OTHER WORDS, DOES THE AUTHOR SEEM TO RECALL WHAT HE SAID EARLIER AND TO BE IN A POSITION TO INTEGRATE IT INTO 
POINTS HE HAS MADE SINCE THEN? 
ARE THE POINTS 'REAL'? ARE THEY FRESH? OR IS SOME INSTITUTION OR SOME ACCEPTED VEIN OF PROPAGANDA OR ORTHODOXY JUST USING THE AUTHOR AS A MOUTH PIECE?
IS THE WRITING EVASIVE OR DIRECT? 
ARE THE STATEMENTS AMBIGUOUS? 
DOES THE PROGRESSION OF THE TEXT DEVELOP ACCORDING TO WHO SAID WHAT OR ACCORDING TO WHAT ENTAILS OR CONFIRMS WHAT? 
DOES THE AUTHOR USER OTHER AUTHORS  TO DEVELOP HIS IDEAS OR TO CLOAK HIS OWN LACK OF IDEAS?" 

YOU MUST CONSIDER THE ALIGNMENT OF YOUR ANSWERS WITH THE ANSWERS YOU WILL GIVE TO: 

"*ARE THERE TERMS THAT ARE UNDEFINED BUT SHOULD BE DEFINED, IN THE SENSE THAT, WITHOUT DEFINITIONS, IT IS DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW WHAT IS BEING
SAID OR THEREFORE TO EVALUATE WHAT IS BEING SAID? IF UNDEFINED TERMS HAVE CLEAR MEANINGS (AS THE DO IN CHEMISTRY OR PHYSICS), THEN IT MAY WELL BE
THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE TO BE DEFINED; BUT IF THEY HAVE NO CANONICAL MEANINGS (E.G. IF THEY ARE IN THE SAME CATEGORY AS "TRANSCENDENTAL EMPIRICISM",
"THEY MYTH OF THE MENTAL", "MINIMAL EMPIRICISM", OR "LINGUISTIC IDEALISM"), AND THEY ARE UNDEFINED, THEN THE 'STATEMENTS' IN QUESTION MUST NOT BE PRESUMED 
TO HAVE MEANINGS, ALBEIT HIDDEN ONES; RATHER, THEY MUST BE TREATED AS WHAT THEY ARE, PLACEHOLDER PSEUDO-STATEMENTS THAT HAVE NO MEANIGNS AND THEREFORE
HAVE NO INTELLIGENT MEANINGS. 

*ARE THERE "FREE VARIABLES" IN THE TEXT? IE ARE THERE QUALIFICATIONS OR POINTS THAT ARE MADE BUT DO NOT CONNECT TO ANYTHING LATER OR EARLIER? 

*DO NEW STATEMENTS DEVELOP OUT OF OLD ONES? OR ARE THEY MERELY "ADDED" TO PREVIOUS ONES, WITHOUT IN ANY SENSE BEING GENERATED BY THEM? 

*DO NEW STATEMENTS CLARIFY OR DO THEY LEAD TO MORE LACK OF CLARITY?"

*IF I WERE TO GIVE A HIGH SCORE TO THIS PASSAGE, WOULD I BE REWARDING IMPOSTOR SCAFFOLDING? IN OTHER WORDS, WOULD I BE REWARDING THAT HAD SOME OF THE 
VERBAL AND CONVENTIONAL TRAPPINGS OF 'HIGH LEVEL TEXT' BUT LACKED ANY DISCERNIBLE SUBSTANCE?

*IF I WERE TO GIVE A HIGH SCORE TO THIS PASSAGE, WOULD I BE REWARDING CONFORMITY TO ACADEMIC/BUREAUCRATIC NORMS? 

*IF I WERE TO GIVE A LOW SCORE TO THIS PASSAGE, WOULD I BE PENALIZING ACTUAL INTELLIGENCE OWING TO A LACK OF CONFORMITY TO 
ACADEMIC/BUREAUCRATIC NORMS?
