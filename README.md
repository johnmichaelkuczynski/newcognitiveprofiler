# üß© NEW COGNITIVE PROFILER

**NEW COGNITIVE PROFILER** is a multi-engine AI reasoning and text-analysis platform that evaluates written content for **cogency, coherence, originality, and cognitive depth**.  
It integrates multiple AI providers (Anthropic, DeepSeek, OpenAI, Perplexity) and unifies their outputs through robust JSON parsing, fallback logic, and proprietary comparative analysis.

## üí° Core Capabilities
- **Multi-Model Integration** ‚Äî Combines outputs from Anthropic, DeepSeek, OpenAI, and Perplexity for composite reasoning.  
- **Cognitive Analysis Engine** ‚Äî Scores essays, arguments, or creative works for clarity, logic, and originality.  
- **JSON-Safe Parsing Layer** ‚Äî Custom logic introduces `JSON_START` markers and fallback handling to ensure stable multi-provider interoperability.  
- **Document Comparison** ‚Äî Aligns and contrasts conceptual structures across multiple texts to detect reasoning patterns or originality gaps.  
- **Credit & Paywall System** ‚Äî Stripe + Supabase integration enables soft paywall preview (~30 % of output free) before unlocking full analysis.  
- **Persistent Profiles** ‚Äî Supabase-backed account system stores user history, metrics, and reports for long-term tracking.  
- **Dynamic Prompt Logic** ‚Äî Context-sensitive routing of prompts to the provider best suited for each analytic task.

## üß† Concept
**NEW COGNITIVE PROFILER** functions as both an *intelligence assessor* and a *cross-model synthesizer*.  
It fuses multiple LLM perspectives into a unified analytical report, quantifying argument quality, conceptual rigor, and stylistic clarity.  
By combining evaluation with real-time humanization logic, it produces reports indistinguishable from expert critique.
